Hello, my name is Moritz »mo.« Sauer and I run [Phlow](http://phlow.de/) and build two clean and flexible themes for [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com).

## [Feeling Responsive](http://phlow.github.io/feeling-responsive/)

»Feeling Responsive« is a responsive theme for Jekyll based on the fabulous foundation framework with beautiful typography and a bright color palette.



## [Responsive One](http://phlow.github.io/responsive-one/)

»Responsive One« is a one-column responsive theme for Jekyll based on the foundation framework inspired by tumblr with seven different post formats.
