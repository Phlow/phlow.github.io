Hello, my name is Moritz »mo.« Sauer and I run [Phlow](http://phlow.de/) and build two clean and flexible themes for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

»Feeling Responsive« is a responsive theme for Jekyll based on the fabulous foundation framework with beautiful typography and a bright color palette.

»Responsive One« is a one-column responsive theme for Jekyll based on the foundation framework inspired by tumblr with seven different post formats.
